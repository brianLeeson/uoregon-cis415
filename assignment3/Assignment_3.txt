1. OSC 7.16
a. Increase Available (new resources added)
	Can be made safely under all circumstances.

b. Decrease Available (resources are permanently removed from the system)
	Can only be made if the system remains in a safe state. If for all i, Finish[i] == true for all processes.

c. Increase Max for one process (the process needs or wants more resources than allowed)
	If recalculation of the different M x N matrices is allowed, then yes provided that 
	the new max does not go over the number of resources in the system.

d. Decrease Max for one process (the process decides it does not need that many resources)
	Decreasing max resources requested is okay in all circumstances.

e. Increase the number of processes
	Increasing the number of processes is okay in all circumstances.
	
f. Decrease the number of processes
	Decreasing the number of processes is okay in all circumstances.

2. OSC 8.13:
Contiguous Memory Allocation
	Over time CMA causes external fragmentation as processes finish out of allocation order. This requires managing the "holes" 
	left by completed processes. Depending on how this managing is done, more memory than is requested can be given to a process if 
	the process requests a relatively small amount of memory, leading to internal fragmentation. Because fragmentation can become severe 
	enough to require compaction, a processes assigned physical address may change 

Pure Segmentation
	Segmentation also will suffer from external fragmentation for the same reasons as CMA, but potentially less so as processes are broken 
	up into smaller segments. Internal fragmentation will also occur for the sames reasons as CMA. Sharing code becomes more difficult than
	CMA as the process is broken up into segments. In order to get the location of a relevant byte, we can no longer got to the beginning of 
	a process plus offset. We must got out to the MUM and find the relevant segment. This is slower than CMA, but similar to Paging.
	
Pure Paging
	Avoids external fragmentation as every process is broken up into pages that evenly fit into frames, so there will never be a page too big
	to fit into a frame. Unless a process is exactly a multiple of the page size there will be internal fragmentation as the last section of the
	process must fit into a page.
