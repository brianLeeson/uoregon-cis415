State of my code
uspsv1, 2, 3, and 4:
compile, run, I believe run to spec, with no memory leaks found by valgrind.

In order to solve a memory leak problem in v3 I did a hack and I am not quite sure if it will work with more complicated testing. 
It does work with the standard workfiles from piazza.

I believe that I am only running one process at a time, but when I test with "top",
it shows that one process is using up ~80% of the cpu, while the previously running process is using ~10%.
I am assuming that this is because top shows the average usage over a time period and over one of it's time periods
two of my processes could be running.

not sure how to test that sigints have been disabled when in onchild handler, but believe that i've done it correctly.
