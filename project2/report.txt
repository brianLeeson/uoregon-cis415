The state of my solution is strong. Compiles and runs without errors. I do not get any of the error diagnostics, 
so no packets are missed coming from the network for the standard 2 minute run. It has also been tested without 
errors on 10 minute run as well. Applications that call nonblocking put sometimes fail as the buffer is full. 
However this makes sense as the applications put packets into the buffer faster than they can be sent to the 
network and the buffer must be bounded, so it should follow that some nonblocking puts will sometimes fail. I 
have tested cleanup after a failure in init and the resources are cleaned, but the calling code segfaults. I 
think this is acceptable.
